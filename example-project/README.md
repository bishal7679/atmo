This is an example project to walk you through building a deploying your first Atmo project.

## Prerequisites

>Note: As of the time of writing, `subo` does not officially support the Windows operating system. You may, however, try installing and using `subo` on [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about#what-is-wsl-2).

First, you will need to have the subo CLI and Docker installed.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) will be used to build Runnables and run the Atmo development server.
- To install subo, [visit its GitHub repository](https://github.com/suborbital/subo) and follow the instructions in the README.

Next, you'll need to [fork and clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo.
